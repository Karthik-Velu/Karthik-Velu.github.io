# Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions (Important!)

For this site to load correctly, you must enable the **GitHub Actions** build process. The site will show a **blank page** until you do this.

1.  Go to your repository **Settings**.
2.  On the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
3.  Under **"Build and deployment"**, look for the **Source** dropdown.
4.  Change the selection from "Deploy from a branch" to **GitHub Actions**.

Once you select "GitHub Actions", the site will automatically rebuild and deploy within 1-2 minutes.
